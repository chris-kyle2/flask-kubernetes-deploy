# Flask Kubernetes Deployment Project ðŸš€

This repository showcases a complete solution for deploying a Flask application on Kubernetes, leveraging CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Infrastructure-as-Code principles using Terraform. The project spans local development with Minikube, cloud deployment with AWS EKS, and monitoring for seamless application performance.

## Project Overview ðŸŽ¯

This project is divided into three main tasks, designed to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of a Flask application:

### **Task 1: Kubernetes and Python**

1. **Python Monitoring Script (`python_script.py`)**  
   - Connects to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Lists all running pods in a specific namespace.
   - Identifies pods not in the `Running` state and fetches their logs.
   - Logs are saved to individual files named `<pod-name>-logs.txt`.

2. **Flask Application (`app.py`)**  
   - A simple Flask app that returns `Hello, World!` when accessed via HTTP.
   - Dockerized using the `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.

3. **Kubernetes YAML Definition (`deployment-service.yaml`)**  
   - Deployment: Manages pod replicas of the Flask app.
   - Service: Configures a LoadBalancer to expose the application via a public URL.
   - Retrieve the app's public endpoint by running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get svc flask-app-service
     ```

---

### **Task 2: GitHub Actions and Linux**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`)**  
   - **Automated Docker Build and Push**  
     - Builds the Flask app Docker image with a Git commit-based tag.
     - Pushes the image to Docker Hub.
   - **Automated Kubernetes Deployment**  
     - Deploys the app to the EKS cluster using `kubectl apply`.
     - Checks deployment status with `kubectl rollout`.
   - **Error Notification**  
     - Sends a Slack notification or logs an error message if the deployment fails.

2. **Local Minikube Setup (`mini_kube_solution.sh`)**  
   - Automates the installation of Minikube and kubectl.
   - Deploys the Flask app locally using the Kubernetes YAML file.

3. **Docker Installation Script (`install_docker.sh`)**  
   - Provides a one-command solution to install Docker on a Linux environment.

---

### **Task 3: Cloud Platform Integration**

1. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform (`Terraform/`)**  
   - Provisions a production-grade EKS cluster on AWS.
   - Sets up a secure VPC with subnets and routing configurations.
   - Configures security groups to allow external traffic to the Flask application.
   - Outputs information about the infrastructure after deployment.

2. **Deployment and Public Access**  
   - After the GitHub Actions workflow completes, retrieve the public URL for the Flask application by running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get svc flask-app-service
     ```
   - The URL will be listed under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column.

3. **Application Monitoring**  
   - Basic monitoring is set up using AWS CloudWatch to track:
     - Application health
     - CPU and memory usage
   - A CloudWatch dashboard displays real-time metrics.

## Instructions ðŸ”§

### **Run Locally with Minikube**

1. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   bash install_docker.sh
   ```
2. **Set Up Minikube and Deploy the App**:
   ```bash
   bash mini_kube_solution.sh
   ```
3. Access the app via the Minikube IP and NodePort:
   ```bash
   minikube service flask-app-service --url
   ```

---

### **Deploy to AWS using GitHub Actions**

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.
2. The CI/CD pipeline will:
   - Build and push the Flask app Docker image to Docker Hub.
   - Deploy the app to the EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests.
3. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc flask-app-service
   ```
4. Access the app via the LoadBalancer's public endpoint.
